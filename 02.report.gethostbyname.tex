Report for Labwork 2

First i have function named "DNS". This function has 2 arguments is "hostname" and "ip".
- ip: hold the IP address of the provided host name
- hostname: will be pass to the function

	int DNS(char*hostname,char*ip) {

Second, i have 2 pointer named "hostent" and "in_addr"
If statement to check the value returned by the "gethostbyname" function. If NULL, print error, else for loop will be run, the DNS will looked up for the ip address

	struct hostent *H;
	    struct in_addr **Addrlist;
	    if ((H = gethostbyname(hostname))==NULL) {
		herror("Error");
		return 1;
	    }
		Addrlist = (struct in_addr **) H->h_addr_list;
	    for (int i=0;Addrlist[i] != NULL;i++) {
		strcpy(ip,inet_ntoa(*Addrlist[i]));
		return 0;
	    }
	    return 1;



Then, main() function accept "argc" and "argv". We have 1 'If' function to check if <=2. This mean i need executable file and the hostname to resolved.

	int main (int argc, char*argv[]) {
	    if (argc<2) {
		printf("No hostport");
	    }
	    
Final, i created pointer named "hostname" and assigned the value of second command line. I created characer array of size 100 bytes to hold the IP address. I call again "DNS" function with the "hostname" and "ip". After that, print hostname and ip address.

	char *hostname = argv[1];
	    char ip[100];
	    DNS(hostname,ip);
	    printf("%s resolve to %s",hostname,ip);
